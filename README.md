# Game of Life Ecosystem Simulation

This project presents an interactive simulation inspired by Conway's Game of Life, enhanced to model a dynamic ecosystem with multiple interacting entities. Developed using JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas, it offers a visual representation of predator-prey relationships and environmental interactions.

## üåø Simulation Overview

The simulation features various entities, each with distinct behaviors:

- **Grass**: Proliferates over time, serving as a food source for herbivores.
- **Grass Eaters**: Herbivores that consume grass to survive and reproduce.
- **Predators**: Carnivores that hunt grass eaters to sustain themselves.
- **Hunters**: Apex predators that target both grass eaters and predators.
- **Consumers**: Entities that interact with multiple species, affecting the ecosystem's balance.

Each entity's behavior is governed by specific rules, and their interactions lead to emergent patterns within the simulated environment.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: Core programming language for logic and interactivity.
- **HTML5 Canvas**: Rendering the simulation grid and entities.
- **CSS**: Styling the simulation interface.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To run the simulation locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ani-dilanyan/game-of-life.git


2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd game-of-life

3. Open index.html in your preferred web browser to start the simulation.
